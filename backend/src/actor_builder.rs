//Note: redundancy and auto-scale features of bastion are not supported for the following reasons:
// 1. channel usage requires lock and parallel actors would not work well and cause deadlocks
// 2. we want clear telemetry on every actor instance, never shared
// 3. there was no way to support this and the code generator without marking the methods unsafe.
// 4. we might use this as an internal feature as it is difficult to get right.
