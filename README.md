## Why Sponsor Steady State?

In today's fast-paced digital landscape, businesses require services that are not only high-performing but also resilient and observable. **Steady State** is poised to meet these demands by offering a comprehensive framework that simplifies the development of robust services across various industries, including:

- **Background Services**: Enhance backend processes with high throughput and fault tolerance.
- **Robotics and IoT**: Ensure precise control and clean shutdowns in critical systems.
- **Distributed Systems**: Build scalable architectures with built-in telemetry and performance monitoring.

Your sponsorship will accelerate the development of this groundbreaking framework, enabling features that will benefit the entire Rust community and beyond.

## Key Features

### Flexible Concurrency Management

- **Easy Async**: Simplify asynchronous programming with ergonomic abstractions.
- **Thread Management**: Easily configure actors to run on a single thread or distribute them across multiple threads for optimal performance.

### Clean Shutdown on Signal

- **Graceful Termination**: Ensure all actors in the system shut down cleanly, preserving data integrity and system stability.
- **Ideal for Critical Systems**: Perfect for robotics and IoT applications where orderly shutdowns are crucial.

### Built-in Prometheus Integration

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Collect metrics out of the box for immediate insights into system performance.
- **Easy Integration**: Seamlessly connect with Prometheus for advanced analytics and alerting.

### Comprehensive Testing Framework

- **Individual Actor Testing**: Isolate and test actors to ensure each component functions correctly.
- **Full Graph Testing**: Validate the entire system's behavior under various scenarios.
- **Mock Actors**: Utilize mock actors for end-to-end and load testing without external dependencies.

## Where Can Steady State Be Used?

- **Backend Services**: Build scalable and resilient microservices.
- **Robotics**: Control complex robotic systems with precise coordination and fault tolerance.
- **IoT Devices**: Manage fleets of devices with reliable communication and clean shutdown capabilities.
- **Financial Systems**: Ensure high availability and data consistency in transaction processing.

## Roadmap

We have an exciting roadmap ahead and your support can make it a reality:

- **Enhanced Test Coverage**: More code coverage for maximum reliability.
- **Video Tutorials**: Produce educational content to help developers adopt Steady State easily.
- **Distributed Actors**: Expand capabilities to support network-wide graphs and distributed computing.
- **Performance Enhancements**: Continually optimize for speed and efficiency.
- **Additional Example Actors**: Provide a library of pre-built actors for common use cases.
