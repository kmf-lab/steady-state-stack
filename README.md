# Steady State: Pioneering Resilient Services with Rust

Welcome to the Steady State project, a pioneering effort to redefine the development of resilient, high-performance services using the Rust programming language. Steady State is designed from the ground up to tackle the most pressing challenges in service development today: ensuring reliability, performance, and observability at scale.

## Why Steady State?

In an era where digital services form the backbone of businesses across industries, the cost of downtime, inefficiency, and lack of visibility can be astronomical. Steady State arises as a solution to these challenges, providing a robust framework that empowers developers to build services that are not just fault-tolerant but thrive in the face of failure.

### Unmatched Reliability

Drawing inspiration from the Erlang ecosystem, Steady State introduces an advanced supervision system that guarantees continuity and reliability. This means your services keep running, even when unexpected failures occur, minimizing downtime and maintaining business operations smoothly.

### Performance at Scale

Steady State leverages Rust's efficiency and the actor model to offer high throughput and fine-grained control over latency. This ensures that your services can handle high volumes of messages and maintain consistent performance, crucial for meeting and exceeding stringent SLA requirements.

### Comprehensive Observability

With built-in telemetry features, Steady State provides real-time insights into your services' performance. This embedded observability enables quick identification and resolution of bottlenecks, facilitating continuous optimization and improvement of service quality.

## Commitment to the Community

Steady State is not just a framework; it's a commitment to the future of resilient service development. We're building a community of developers, contributors, and users who share a passion for creating reliable, high-performance services with Rust. Join us on this exciting journey to shape the future of service development.

## Getting Started

The project is structured into a main workspace with the core framework located in the `backend` folder. For detailed technical documentation, examples, and guides on how to use Steady State for your projects, please refer to the README in the `backend` folder.

### Contributing
