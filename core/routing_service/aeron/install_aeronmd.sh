#The C Media Driver supports a subset of configuration options which are relevant for the Driver, i.e.:
# aeron.event.log.filename (or as AERON_EVENT_LOG_FILENAME env variable): System property for the file to which the log is appended. If not set then STDOUT will be used. Logging to file is significantly more efficient than logging to STDOUT.
# aeron.event.log (or as AERON_EVENT_LOG env variable): System property containing a comma separated list of Driver event codes. These are also special events: all for all possible events and admin for administration events.
# aeron.event.log.disable (or as AERON_EVENT_LOG_DISABLE env variable): System property containing a comma separated list of Driver events to exclude.

# Easy test to confirm aeronmd is working, run in two terminals
# docker exec -it aeronmd /build/binaries/basic_publisher -s 123
# docker exec -it aeronmd /build/binaries/basic_subscriber -s 123
# or
# docker exec -it aeronmd /build/binaries/streaming_publisher -s=123 -m 1000 -L 8
