### Unlock the Power of Resilient Rust Services with Steady State

In the fast-paced world of modern software, resilience and performance aren’t optional—they’re essential. Whether you’re running backend services, managing IoT devices, or orchestrating complex robotics, your systems need to handle failures gracefully, process messages efficiently, and keep running no matter what.

That’s where **Steady State** comes in. Built for Rust developers who demand safety, scalability, and simplicity, Steady State takes the complexity out of building resilient, high-performance systems. Let me show you why it matters and how it can transform the way you develop services.

### The Problem: Complexity Meets Concurrency

Concurrency is hard. Building systems that are both performant and reliable often leads to sprawling codebases, convoluted logic, and a minefield of potential race conditions. Add the need for observability and clean shutdowns, and you’re looking at an uphill battle.

If you’ve wrestled with async code, struggled to debug distributed systems, or spent late nights hunting down a subtle threading bug, you’re not alone. These challenges aren’t just frustrating—they’re expensive.

Steady State solves these problems by embracing simplicity and leveraging Rust’s memory safety guarantees. With a framework designed to handle the hard parts for you, you can focus on delivering value, not debugging deadlocks.

### What is Steady State?

At its core, Steady State is a framework for building actor-based systems in Rust. It simplifies concurrency, provides built-in telemetry for observability, and ensures reliable performance even under heavy load. Here’s what sets it apart:

- **Simplicity**: Model your actor system using Graphviz DOT files and generate clean, boilerplate-free Rust code.
- **Transparency**: Real-time insights through Prometheus integration help you see exactly what’s happening inside your system.
- **Reliability**: Graceful shutdown logic and fault-tolerant design keep your system running smoothly.
- **Efficiency**: High throughput and batch processing mean you can handle millions of messages without breaking a sweat.

### How It Works

Steady State uses the actor model to structure your application. Each actor is an isolated unit of logic that communicates with others via message passing. This design naturally avoids shared-state issues and scales beautifully across threads and cores.

Here’s how you get started:

1. **Define Your Actor Graph**: Write a Graphviz DOT file to map out your system’s actors and their relationships.
2. **Generate Code**: Use the `cargo-steady-state` CLI to turn your DOT file into a Rust project.
3. **Focus on Business Logic**: Implement your actors’ behavior and let Steady State handle the rest—from threading to telemetry.

### Real-World Applications

Steady State shines in scenarios where performance, reliability, and observability are critical. Here are just a few examples:

- **IoT Device Management**: Keep fleets of devices in sync while ensuring clean shutdowns during updates.
- **Robotics**: Coordinate complex actions with precise timing and fault tolerance.
- **Backend Microservices**: Build scalable, resilient services with real-time metrics.
- **Financial Systems**: Ensure high availability and consistency for transaction processing.

### Built-In Features for Modern Development

#### Observability with Prometheus
Steady State integrates seamlessly with Prometheus, giving you real-time metrics out of the box. Monitor message rates, CPU utilization, and actor health with minimal setup.

#### Comprehensive Testing
Testing isn’t an afterthought. Steady State includes tools for unit testing individual actors, validating entire graphs, and mocking external dependencies.

#### Flexible Concurrency
Easily configure actors to run on dedicated threads or share threads for optimized resource use—perfect for scaling across multi-core systems.

#### Graceful Shutdowns
Whether it’s a signal from your orchestration system or a manual restart, Steady State ensures every actor shuts down in an orderly, data-safe way.
